    This link.xml file is provided to prevent MRTK code from being optimized away

    If your application doesn't use some specific services (for example, if teleportation system is 
    disabled in the profile), it is possible to remove their corresponding lines down 
    below (in the previous example, we would remove the TeleportSystem below). 
    It's recommended to start with this list and narrow down if you want to ensure 
    specific bits of code get optimized away.
